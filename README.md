## What Did I Make?
Tourist Assistant application service specified in Dublin (feat. Chatbot)

## Abstract
Ireland has unique characteristics in terms of Tourism, such as pubs and St. Patrick's Day. Especially Dublin is commonly known for Tourism and many tourists are visiting this city. Also, in terms of the total income of Ireland, Tourism accounts for a significant portion. Therefore, we can say that Tourism plays an important role in Dublin.

Due to COVID-19 from 2020, the number of travellers who visit Dublin has decreased compared to before. However, after a long period of lockdown, the tourism regulations have been easing these days. Therefore, it is expected that Tourism will be revitalized again in Dublin.


As explained earlier, the purpose of this project is to revitalize Tourism in Dublin. The idea mainly focusses on making travel to Dublin easier for the user. To do this, various datasets will be used by requesting to the other data APIs. Also, I implement a chatbot to talk with users interactively by training the network model.


As a result, I will suggest a helpful tourism assistant mobile application for travels who want, plan, or already do a trip to Dublin.
